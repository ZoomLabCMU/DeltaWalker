Folders
    0_manual_design - manually designed trajectories results
    1_ocrl_trials - trajectory optimized trajectories results
    2_ocrl_variations - trajectory optimized trajectories with variance in foot ordering but same general pattern results
    3_ocrl_further_studies - further studies with trajectory optimized trajectories

Code
    1_video_adjust - convert raw video to mp4, undistort and crop the frames - saved in adjusted video folder
                        after video is saved as adjusted it is manually trimmed to remove excess time
                        when the robot is not doing anything and saved in trimmed video folder
    2_video_processing - foot detection on the trimmed video and annotated version of the video saved to annotated video folder
    3_video_speedup - speed up the videos - use videos from adjusted and saved to speedy folder
    4_data_processing - convert pixels to cm
    5_data_analysis - analyze the movement by comparing start to finish points with respect to the desired point
    6_step_process - user based interface to analyze the amount of time it takes for the robot to reach each step point to analyze single steps
    7_plotting_0/1/2/3 - plotting for the various folders of testing
    add_frame1 - speed up videos and annotate with estimation of the trajectories each foot follows
    livecam - livecam for viewing the testing setup with color detection
    processing_helpers - helper functions for data processing

Video folders
    You will need to make a folder in each of the main folders named "videos"
    That folder should have the following folders
        raw
        adjusted
        trimmed
        annotated
        speedy
        speedy_ann
